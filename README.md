# Real Time Image Ganeraation
The Real-Time Image Generation project focuses on leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Diffusion Models, to create images dynamically based on user input or predefined parameters. This project has applications in industries such as entertainment, healthcare, e-commerce, and education.

## Project info
To design and implement a system capable of generating high-quality images in real-time based on textual descriptions, sketches, or other user-defined inputs.

## Features
## Input Modalities:

Text-to-Image Generation:  Users provide descriptive text, and the system generates corresponding images.
Sketch-to-Image Conversion: Users upload rough sketches that are converted into realistic images.
Parameterized Image Generation:Users define parameters like color, style, or object type for image customization.
## Real-Time Processing:
The system responds to user inputs in seconds, providing an interactive experience.
Includes progress feedback during image generation.

## Customizability:
Style options: Photorealistic, abstract, cartoonish, etc.
Resolution settings for optimized performance.
## AI-Powered Models:
Use of GANs, Stable Diffusion, or other cutting-edge algorithms for image generation.
Pre-trained and fine-tuned models to improve generation quality.
## Cross-Platform Availability:
Web-based interface for easy accessibility.
API integration for other applications to use the generation feature.

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <image>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev


## What technologies are used for this project?

This project is built with .

## Frontend:
Framework: The project uses Vite for development and build processes.
React: The presence of React-related dependencies such as @hookform/resolvers indicates this is a React-based project.
Styling:Tailwind CSS is configured (inferred from tailwind.config.ts).
Radix UI components (e.g., @radix-ui/react-accordion, @radix-ui/react-avatar) for accessible, styled React components.
Linting: ESLint is used for code quality.

## Backend:
The backend functionality is minimal or entirely front-end focused, as indicated by the absence of explicit backend frameworks. The project is likely intended to serve static files or rely on external APIs.
## Development Tools:
Vite: For a fast build and development server.
TypeScript: Likely used, based on the tailwind.config.ts file.
## How can I deploy this project?
